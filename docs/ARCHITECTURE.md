# Architecture Notes

## Client/server import boundaries

TanStack Start builds client and server environments from overlapping route modules, so server-only dependencies must be explicit.

Use TanStack import-protection markers at the top of boundary-only modules:

```ts
import '@tanstack/react-start/server-only'
```

Use this for modules that touch secrets, Postgres, Drizzle server adapters, Better Auth server instances, or `@rocicorp/zero/server`. These modules must not be imported directly by client components or shared route code.

```ts
import '@tanstack/react-start/client-only'
```

Use this only for modules that cannot run during SSR.

Shared modules, route components, and `createServerFn` wrappers should stay marker-free unless they are truly one-environment-only. If shared code needs server work, call a server function or dynamically import a marked server module from inside server-only execution.
